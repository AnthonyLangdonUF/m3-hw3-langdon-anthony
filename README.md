  <section><h3>An adverse beginning</h3>
    <p>A lengthy profile from ESPN reporter and .Paak's old neighbor Dwayne Bray paints a stark shift in the Black and Korean-American musician's youth - from rich in love with material wealth to boot, to a home broken by his father's drug addiction, attempted murder of .Paak's mother, and his mother's long-term jail sentence for business fraud.</p>
    <p>Through it all, .Paak buried his head in music. Starting as the drummer at his family's church, he eventually starting producing his own music and rapping on songs. Two marriages, one son and a stint of homelessness later, 'Breezy Lovejoy,' as he was once known, took his current moniker and worked odd jobs in the Los Angeles music scene until releasing his debut album <em>Venice</em> in 2014. A year later, he featured on a whopping six tracks of Dr. Dre's album, <em>Compton.</em></section>
